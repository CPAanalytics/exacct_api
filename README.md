Example of [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) integration supported by almighty [Pydantic 2.0](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic)
with [SQLAlchemy ORM](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and PostgreSQL 
connected via fastest Database Client Library for python/asyncio [asyncpg](https://github.com/MagicStack/asyncpg).

Beside of using latest and greatest version of [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) with it robustness, powerfulness and speed
of [asyncpg](https://github.com/MagicStack/asyncpg) there is [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) (modern, fast (high-performance), 
web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based on standard Python type hints.) already reviewed
on [thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks?blipid=202104087) and noted in 
Python Developers [Survey 2021 Results](https://lp.jetbrains.com/python-developers-survey-2021/#FrameworksLibraries)
as the fifth official annual Python Developers Survey, conducted as a collaborative effort between the Python Software Foundation and JetBrains.

### How to feed database

It took me a while to find nice data set. Hope works of Shakespeare as example will be able to cover 
first part with read only declarative base configuration and all type of funny selects :)
Data set is coming form https://github.com/catherinedevlin/opensourceshakespeare
Next models were generated with https://github.com/agronholm/sqlacodegen
And after some tweaking I got desired result

### Rainbow logs with rich :rainbow:

To deliver better user(developer) experience when watching logs with tons of information
from few emitters (which are really needy on development stage) project is using [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) library.
Event with [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) superpowers reading logs is not easy.
Found [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) really nice - 
but it took time to learn how to integrate it as logger object properly and keep it as singleton.

To address below needs: 
- it is hard to find what I am looking for even with glasses on.
- donâ€™t want to hire ELK to be able to use logs. 
- want to move fast enough with debugging.

Below steps were done to integrate [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) into project.
1. Configure emitters with [config.ini](https://github.com/grillazz/fastapi-sqlalchemy-asyncpg/blob/main/config.ini)
2. Eliminate duplicates i.e. sqlalchemy echo by separate handlers
3. Keep logger as singleton pattern to avoid multiple instances
4. add uvicorn parameter --log-config config.ini
